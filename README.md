# Vision-Pipeline
The Joker's #4320 Vision Processing Framework for the First Robotics Competition (FRC).   
The code is written entirely in Python 3, but also uses a JSON files to get user specific data for the creation of the pipeline.

## Installation

### Requirements
* Python 3.6 or higher
* OpenCV
* Flask
* Numpy
* Pynetwotktables

Install all of the above libraries to run the code and then you can run main.py.
If you don't know how to install any of the libraries check our installation guide.

## Code Highlights
* Built in calibration of any camera, This includes any type of a camera paramter (as long as the camera supports it).
* Very verstile framework, It is easy to add new pipelines, Quirks and methods and functions.
* Takes about X miliseconds to build a pipeline.
* The code is open source and we highely encourge using it!
* The code was entirely written by high school students which are listed in the credits part.

## Project Philosophy
The project is based on a pipeline object.
Once you have a pipeline object you can call the main pipeline method - process_image and it will process the given image by your configurations.

### Pipeline
Pipeline is a class that represents a set of operational stages which are preformed one after the other on an image, 
which we get from the camera. All this is done once process_image is called in the main methoed. 

These stages inculde but not limted to the followings:
* Modification stage - which uses diffrent modifiers to modify the image.
* Extraction stage - which uses diffrent extractors to extract contours from the image.
* Filter stage - which uses diffrent filters to filter the extracted contours.
* Calculation stage - which uses diffrent calculations to calculate data from the filtered contours.
* Publishing stage - which uses diffrent publishers to publish data into to the a desired machine. 

See [pipeline class](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/develop/pipeline/pipeline.py) to better understand the algorithm that builds the pipeline.

### Conventions  
Every stage from the list above is represented by a directory.
This directory is genrally referred to as Quirks directory.
Quirk is every file that cointains a class that is used in the pipeline for any purpouse.
Each Directory contains a "Main Quirk" which is an abstract class and is called Quirk.
Each and every implementation of the "Main Quirk" is given a name for example Foo.

And now here is an example:  
For the Modification Stage there is a directory called modifiers. 
This directory contains the "Main Quirk" which is called modifer.
Each and every Quirk in this directory implements The Main Quirk. 
For example the Blur Modifier implements Modifier (which is the Main Quirk). 

For the file conventions see the PEP8 convention guide.

### Modification Stage:
The first stage of the pipeline, during this stage we get a frame from the camera and applie diffrent modifier quirks on it to get a good image for the extraction stage.

Main Quirk: modifier, see [modifier quirk](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/develop/modifiers/modifier.py) for more info.  

Class Quirks:  
* Blur - See [blur modifier](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/develop/modifiers/blur.py) for more info.
* Morph - See [morph modifier](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/develop/modifiers/morph.py) for more info.
* Color Treshold - See [color treshold modifier](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/develop/modifiers/color_threshold.py) for more info.


### Extraction Stage:
The second stage of the pipeline, during this stage we get the modified frame from the previous stage and extract all the contours from it by their type.

Main Quirk: extractor, see [extractor class](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/develop/extractors/extractor.py) for more info.  

Class Quirks:
* Circles - See [circles_extractor class](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/develop/extractors/circles_extractor.py) for more info.
* Simple - See [simple extractor class](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/develop/extractors/simple_extractor.py) for more info.


### Filter Stage:
The third stage of the pipeline, during this stage we get contours from the previous stage and filter them by diffrent parameters, like size,shape, aspect ratio and so on.

Main Quirk: filter, see [filter class](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/develop/filters/filter.py) for more info.  

Class Quirks:
* Area Range - See [area range filter](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/develop/filters/area_range_filter.py) for more info.
* Area Ratio - See [area ratio filter](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/develop/filters/area_ratio_filter.py) for more info.
* Aspect Ratio - See [aspect ratio filter](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/filters/filters/aspect_ratio_filter.py) for more info.
* Biggest Area - See [biggest area filter](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/filters/filters/biggest_area_filter.py) for more info.
* Diagonal Reflective Tape - See [diagonal reflective tape pair filter](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/filters/filters/diagonal_reflective_tape_pair_filter.py) for more info.
* Shpae - See [shape filter](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/filters/filters/shape_filter.py) for more info.

### Calculation Stage:
The fourth stage of the pipeline, during this stage we use the diffrent filtered contours from the previous stage for many diffrent calculations, these inculde distance and angle calcualtions for every filterd contour.

Main Quirk: calculation, see [calculation class](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/develop/calculations/modifier.py) for more info.  

Class Quirks:
* Angle - See [angle calculation](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/develop/calculations/angle_calculation.py) for more info.
* more will be added soon!

### Publishing Stage:
The last stage of the pipeline, during this stage we send (publish) the calcultaions from the previous stage to the desired Robot, Computer or any other working machine that can run python.

Main Quirk: publisher, see [publisher class](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/develop/publishers/publish.py) for more info.  
Class Quirks:
* Logging Publisher - See [logging class](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/develop/publishers/logging_publisher.py) for more info.
* Network Table Publisher - See [morph class](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/develop/publishers/network_table_publisher.py) for more info.

### Pipeline Creation
The framework uses a json file as a way of creating a pipeline.  
For an example file you see can check the [examples directory](https://github.com/TheJoker4320/vision-framework/blob/develop/examples).   
We highely recommend you will be famillar with JSON before trying the pipeline.
